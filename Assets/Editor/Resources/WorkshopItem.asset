  Title: Encrypted Indicators
  Description: 'Because what we needed was harder edgework, this widget aims to make
    you perpetually unsure of what indicators are present. Included is an appendix
    page containing a decryption guide.


    NOTE: This widget only works with mod modules. The vanilla modules are not powerful
    enough to solve the encryption!


    For your convenience, you can lower the maximum number of encrypted indicators
    in the settings file. (This won''t stop them from spawning, but they will NOT
    be encrypted!)'
